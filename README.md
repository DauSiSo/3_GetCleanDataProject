### Intro

This project is to process raw data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data is combined into a single file, and only data points related to mean or standard deviation are extracted. A summary of the data group by each subject and activity is presented in the tidyData.txt

The followings are the files made up of this project:

1. CodeBook.md - contain descriptioins of each variable used in the code and major steps to clean up the data 
2. run_analysis.R - contain the code to reproduce the tidyData.txt output file
